<h1>Sponsorship</h1>

<p style="padding-top: 40px;">Pet owners and their furry family members are consumers with serious purchasing power, unique habits and represent a compelling target market for many businesses. Currently there are more than 5,000 registered dogs in the City of Somerville, but animal control estimates that there are closer to 9,000 pooches living within our City walls.</p>

<p>Because owning and providing for an animal is such an emotional activity, pet parents are more likely to build relationships and form loyalties with local businesses, restaurants and boutiques if they know that the business owners love their pets too. Local businesses that wish to support som|dog’s initiatives can sponsor the nonprofit on many levels.</p>

<p>For questions or more information contact our Vice President of Marketing and Fundraising, Katie Stinchon – <a href="mailto:katie@somdog.org">katie@somdog.org</a></p>
